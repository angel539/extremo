### Abstract.
Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) uses models as the main assets in the software development process. The structure of a model is described through a meta-model and therefore modelling and meta-modelling are recurrent activities in MDE. While there is a vast amount of MDE tools nowadays, modelling and meta-modelling are tasks typically performed in an unassisted way. One reason for this situation is that these tools cannot extract useful knowledge for modelling, which might be found in heterogeneous information sources, such as XML, RDF, CSV or other models and meta-models.

In order to facilitate modelling at any level of the process, we propose an assistant for modelling and meta-modelling. The assistant enables the gathering of information from sources in various technological spaces. These can be queried uniformly by means of an extensible mechanism, which can make use of services, e.g., for synonym search and word sense analysis. The query results can then be easily incorporated into the (meta-)model being built.

The assistant, called Extremo, has been developed as an Eclipse plugin and it has been validated by case studies in the process modelling and production systems domains. We report on the evaluation of different aspects of Extremo, including its integration with various modelling and meta-modelling environments, the provision of handlers for several heterogeneous sources, a catalogue of general queries and a user study.
