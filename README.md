# Extremo
## Automated modelling assistance by integrating heterogeneous information sources

Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) uses models as the main assets in the software development process. The structure of a model is described through a meta-model and therefore modelling and meta-modelling are recurrent activities in MDE. While there is a vast amount of MDE tools nowadays, modelling and meta-modelling are tasks typically performed in an unassisted way. One reason for this situation is that these tools cannot extract useful knowledge for modelling, which might be found in heterogeneous information sources, such as XML, RDF, CSV or other models and meta-models.

In order to improve this situation, we propose an approach to provide modelling and meta-modelling assistance. The approach gathers heterogeneous information sources in various technological spaces, and represents them uniformly in a common data model. This permits their uniform query, by means of an extensible mechanism, which can make use of services, e.g., for synonym search and word sense analysis. The query results can then be easily  incorporated into the (meta-)model being built.

The approach has been realized in a tool, called Extremo, developed as an Eclipse plugin. It has been validated by case studies in the process modelling and production systems domains. We report on the evaluation of different aspects of Extremo, including its integration with various modelling and meta-modelling environments, the provision of handlers for several heterogeneous information sources, a catalogue of general queries and a user evaluation showing good results.

This project is part of a research work made by the Modelling & Software Engineering Research Group of the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid, Spain. You can get more information in the <a href="http://angel539.github.io/extremo/">next website</a> or writting an email to Angel.MoraS@uam.es
