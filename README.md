Abstract:

Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) uses models as its main assets in the software development process. The structure of a model is described through a meta-model. Even though modelling and meta-modelling are recurrent activities in MDE and a vast amount of MDE tools exist nowadays, they are tasks typically performed in an unassisted way. Usually, these tools cannot extract useful knowledge available in heterogeneous information sources like XML, RDF, CSV or other models and meta-models. We propose an approach to provide modelling and meta-modelling assistance. The approach gathers heterogeneous information sources in various technological spaces, and represents them uniformly in a common data model. This enables their uniform querying, by means of an extensible mechanism, which can make use of services, e.g., for synonym search and word sense analysis. The query results can then be easily incorporated into the (meta-)model being built. The approach has been realized in the Extremo tool, developed as an Eclipse plugin. Extremo has been validated in the context of two domains – production systems and process modelling – taking into account a large and complex industrial standard for classification and product description. Further validation results indicate that the integration of Extremo in various modelling environments can be achieved with low effort, and that the tool is able to handle information from most existing technological spaces.

#### Extremo: An Eclipse plugin for modelling and meta-modelling assistance.
Science of Computer Programming, Volume 180, 2019, p.71-80, ISSN 0167-6423, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2019.05.003.

Abstract:

Modelling is a core activity in software development paradigms like Model-driven Engineering (MDE). Therefore, the quality of (meta-)models is crucial for the success of software projects. However, many times, modelling becomes a purely manual activity, which does not take advantage of information embedded in heterogeneous information sources, such as XML documents, ontologies, or other models and meta-models. In order to improve this situation, we present Extremo, an Eclipse plugin aimed at gathering the information stored in heterogeneous sources in a common data model, to facilitate the reuse of information chunks in the model being built. The tool covers the steps needed to incorporate this knowledge within an external modelling tool, supporting the uniform query of the heterogeneous sources and the evaluation of constraints. Flexibility of the main features (e.g., supported data formats, queries) is achieved by means of extensible mechanisms. To illustrate the usefulness of Extremo, we describe a practical case study in the financial domain and evaluate its performance and scalability.

Abstract:

Model-driven engineering (MDE) uses models as first-class artefacts during the software development lifecycle. MDE often relies on domain-specific languages (DSLs) to develop complex systems. The construction of a new DSL implies a deep understanding of a domain, whose relevant knowledge may be scattered in heterogeneous artefacts, like XML documents, (meta-)models, and ontologies, among others. This heterogeneity hampers their reuse during (meta-)modelling processes. Under the hypothesis that reusing heterogeneous knowledge helps in building more accurate models, more efficiently, in previous works we built a (meta-)modelling assistant called Extremo. Extremo represents heterogeneous information sources with a common data model, supports its uniform querying and reusing information chunks for building (meta-)models. To understand how and whether modelling assistants—like Extremo—help in designing a new DSL, we conducted an empirical study, which we report in this paper. In the study, participants had to build a meta-model, and we measured the accuracy of the artefacts, the perceived usability and utility and the time to completion of the task. Interestingly, our results show that using assistance did not lead to faster completion times. However, participants using Extremo were more effective and efficient, produced meta-models with higher levels of completeness and correctness, and overall perceived the assistant as useful. The results are not only relevant to Extremo, but we discuss their implications for future modelling assistants.
