abstract={The state-space analysis and synthesis part of automatic control theory is abstract in theory, difficult to calculate and hard to understand. In order to change the former teaching way and carry on teaching revolution, the experimental platform is designed. In this experimental platform, MATLAB 7 is adopted to realize the interface program design. The platform includes the main content of state-space theory such as modeling and solving of state-space representation, structural decomposition, etc. For strengthening the relationship between classical and modern control theory, time-domain simulation result curve is shown in some interfaces so as to help the students grasp the corresponding theory about state-space analysis more deeply. From the application, it can be seen that the experiment platform man-machine interface is friendly, operation is easy and convenient. It lays solid foundation for study and teaching innovation.},

abstract={The main problems to represent the qualitative concept of "interest" lie in not only fuzziness but also randomness. Cloud model is a model of the uncertain transition between qualitative concept and its quantitative representation. Cloud model can describe randomness and fuzziness in a unified way. This paper analyzes which of the observed user behaviors can be taken as a source of implicit feedback to capture user interests. This paper provides a model based cloud theory for analyzing the correlation between user behaviors and user interests.

pages={1056-1060},
abstract={The situations of context absence and sparse feature in short texts present a challenge to effective personalized service, especially in the recommend short texts, widened semantic gap between low-level text features representation and high-level interpretation. Meanwhile, the propagation characteristics of short texts also have an effect on the results of recommend short texts. However, the traditional methods of recommend short texts rarely take the above two aspects into account when recommending short texts to users. To solve the above problems, this paper presents a microblogging recommend method based on user model. This method maps the feature of microblogging to the semantic concept by Semantic Extension Method, then calculates the similarity of user model and semantic microblogging, furthermore calculates the factor of microblogging's forwarding and comments, and lastly comprehensively considers the similarity and factor to recommend microblogging to users. Experiments show that the method of recommend microblogging based on user model is better than traditional methods. Users are more satisfied with the recommend results by user model than by traditional methods, and have a very high appraisal of this recommend method.},

abstract={Facing lager amount of web academic information and resources, collaborative filtering is an effective way to improve the efficiency of researchers information seeking. We can predict the researcher interest and needed by collaborative users which have similar interest to current researcher. So how to discover collaborative users is a key issue in collaborative filtering. But current existing methods cannot meet the needs of academic researchers from the user cognitive capacity and level. According to the current problems existing in the research, this paper proposes an approach which obtains the user's interest and discovers collaborative users based on psychology model. First, we proposed Browsing Interest Model for Personalized Service based on attitude behavior relationship model in psychology. Secondly, the paper presents a users similarity measure method based on the contrast model in psychology between users in the academic database which is Similarity Measure Mode for Personalized Service. Finally, according to acquired user interest which is represented by Concept-Relation Graph for Personalized Service and an improved user similarity measure method between users which is expressed by SMMPS that we can obtain collaborative users. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is better than the traditional algorithm for discovering collaborative users in academic database.},

abstract={The traditional personalized recommendation system measures the quality of recommendation performance by the indicators of precision and recall. User model based on user browsing behavior plays an increasingly important role in personalized recommendation systems. The evaluation of user model is significant for personalized recommendation systems, which mainly focuses on the contents of subjects. Taking into account user's priority for the subjects, we urgently need to make an evaluation for the performance of user model. In this paper, an evaluation framework on performance of priority in user model is introduced, and the similarity calculation method of interest structure is designed. According to this, the evaluation method of stability of update mechanism for user model over an interval is proposed. Ten users verify the similarity of interest priority between their user models and actual interests by priority precision (p_pre) and priority recall (p_rec), and test the degrees of stability of user models for two months in the experiment when users' interests changed continually. The results show that the proposed method is more successful than traditional method in the measurement of interest priority.},

abstract={Modern scientific databases and web databases maintain large and heterogeneous data. These real-world databases contain hundreds or even thousands of relations and attributes. Traditional predefined query forms are not able to satisfy various ad-hoc queries from users on those databases. This paper proposes DQF, a novel database query form interface, which is able to dynamically generate query forms. The essence of DQF is to capture a user's preference and rank query form components, assisting him/her in making decisions. The generation of a query form is an iterative process and is guided by the user. At each iteration, the system automatically generates ranking lists of form components and the user then adds the desired form components into the query form. The ranking of form components is based on the captured user preference. A user can also fill the query form and submit queries to view the query result at each iteration. In this way, a query form could be dynamically refined until the user is satisfied with the query results. We utilize the expected F-measure for measuring the goodness of a query form. A probabilistic model is developed for estimating the goodness of a query form in DQF. Our experimental evaluation and user study demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the system.},

abstract={Recent years have witnessed the explosive growth of online social media. Weibo, a famous "Chinese Twitter", has attracted over half billion users in less than four years. Among them are zombie users or bogus users, who are seemingly active common users but actually marionettes manipulated by intelligent software for economic interests. To probe such users thus becomes critically important for a healthy Weibo, but the existing studies along this line are still in initial stage due to the serious lack of labeled zombies and the limited attributes for user profiling. In light of this, in this paper, we figure out a commercial way for training set labeling, and propose a two-stage cascading model called ProZombie for zombie user recognition. ProZombie decomposes the training/predicting process into fast and refined phases in cascade, which greatly improves the modeling efficiency without sacrificing the accuracy. Moreover, 35 attributes including 16 newly proposed ones are employed for a panoramic description of Weibo users. Experiments on real-world labeled Weibo users demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ProZombie. More interestingly, two case studies based on ProZombie successfully unveil the zombies hidden around common users, and their impact to information propagation on Weibo. To our best knowledge, this study is among the first to quantify these interesting observations on Weibo.},

abstract={Mobile networks enable users to post on social media services (e.g., Twitter) from anywhere and anytime. This new phenomenon led to the emergence of a new line of work of mining the behavior of mobile users taking into account the spatio-temporal aspects of their engagement with online social media. In this paper, we address the problem of recommending the right locations to users at the right time. We claim to propose the first comprehensive model, called STT (Spatio-Temporal Topic), to capture the spatio-temporal aspects of user check-ins in a single probabilistic model for location recommendation. Our proposed generative model does not only captures spatio-temporal aspects of check-ins, but also profiles users. We conduct experiments on real life data sets from Twitter, Go Walla, and Bright kite. We evaluate the effectiveness of STT by evaluating the accuracy of location recommendation. The experimental results show that STT achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art models in the areas of recommender systems as well as topic modeling.},

pages={1331-1344},
abstract={This paper presents a knowledge discovery framework for the construction of Community Web Directories, a concept that we introduced in our recent work, applying personalization to Web directories. In this context, the Web directory is viewed as a thematic hierarchy and personalization is realized by constructing user community models on the basis of usage data. In contrast to most of the work on Web usage mining, the usage data that are analyzed here correspond to user navigation throughout the Web, rather than a particular Web site, exhibiting as a result a high degree of thematic diversity. For modeling the user communities, we introduce a novel methodology that combines the users' browsing behavior with thematic information from the Web directories. Following this methodology, we enhance the clustering and probabilistic approaches presented in previous work and also present a new algorithm that combines these two approaches. The resulting community models take the form of Community Web Directories. The proposed personalization methodology is evaluated both on a specialized artificial and a general-purpose Web directory, indicating its potential value to the Web user. The experiments also assess the effectiveness of the different machine learning techniques on the task.},

title={P-CSREC: A New Approach for Personalized Cloud Service Recommendation},
year={2018},
volume={6},
number={},
pages={35946-35956},
abstract={It is becoming a challenging issue for users to choose a satisfied service to fit their need due to the rapid growing number of cloud services and the vast amount of service type varieties. This paper proposes an effective cloud service recommendation approach, named personalized cloud service recommendation (P-CSREC), based on the characterization of heterogeneous information network, the use of association rule mining, and the modeling and clustering of user interests. First, a similarity measure is defined to improve the average similarity (AvgSim) measure by the inclusion of the subjective evaluation of users' interests. Based on the improved AvgSim, a new model for measuring the user interest is established. Second, the traditional K-Harmonic Means (KHM) clustering algorithm is improved by means of involving multi meta-paths to avoid the convergence of local optimum. Then, a frequent pattern growth (FP-Growth) association rules algorithm is proposed to address the issue and the limitation of traditional association rule algorithms to offer personalization in recommendation. A new method to define a support value of nodes is developed using the weight of user's score. In addition, a multi-level FP-Tree is defined based on the multi-level association rules theory to extract the relationship in higher level. Finally, a combined user interest with the improved KHM clustering algorithm and the improved FP-Growth algorithm is provided to improve accuracy of cloud services recommendation to target users. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach in improving the computational efficiency and recommendation accuracy.},

pages={2086-2099},
abstract={Social recommender system, using social relation networks as additional input to improve the accuracy of traditional recommender systems, has become an important research topic. However, most existing methods utilize the entire user relationship network with no consideration to its huge size, sparsity, imbalance, and noise issues. This may degrade the efficiency and accuracy of social recommender systems. This study proposes a new approach to manage the complexity of adding social relation networks to recommender systems. Our method first generates an individual relationship network (IRN) for each user and item by developing a novel fitting algorithm of relationship networks to control the relationship propagation and contracting. We then fuse matrix factorization with social regularization and the neighborhood model using IRN's to generate recommendations. Our approach is quite general, and can also be applied to the item-item relationship network by switching the roles of users and items. Experiments on four datasets with different sizes, sparsity levels, and relationship types show that our approach can improve predictive accuracy and gain a better scalability compared with state-of-the-art social recommendation methods.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a collaborative filtering method designed to improve the current memory-based prediction times without worsening and even improving the existing accuracy results. The accuracy improvement is achieved by combining the numerical relevance of the ratings with non-numerical information based on the votes structure. The improvement of the prediction time is achieved by setting four actions: 1) simplification of the similarity measure design, in order to minimize the necessary calculations; 2) construction and maintenance of a model that simplifies the predictions processing; 3) optimization of the computation, using a set-based model and a bit-based processing implementation; and 4) switching between the bit processing and the numerical processing, depending on the density of the users' ratings. Experimental results show the improvements both in the prediction time and the accuracy. Experiments have used a significant amount of state-of-the-art baselines and collaborative filtering public data sets.},

title={BiRank: Towards Ranking on Bipartite Graphs},
year={2017},
volume={29},
number={1},
pages={57-71},
abstract={The bipartite graph is a ubiquitous data structure that can model the relationship between two entity types: for instance, users and items, queries and webpages. In this paper, we study the problem of ranking vertices of a bipartite graph, based on the graph's link structure as well as prior information about vertices (which we term a query vector). We present a new solution, BiRank, which iteratively assigns scores to vertices and finally converges to a unique stationary ranking. In contrast to the traditional random walk-based methods, BiRank iterates towards optimizing a regularization function, which smooths the graph under the guidance of the query vector. Importantly, we establish how BiRank relates to the Bayesian methodology, enabling the future extension in a probabilistic way. To show the rationale and extendability of the ranking methodology, we further extend it to rank for the more generic n-partite graphs. BiRank's generic modeling of both the graph structure and vertex features enables it to model various ranking hypotheses flexibly. To illustrate its functionality, we apply the BiRank and TriRank (ranking for tripartite graphs) algorithms to two real-world applications: a general ranking scenario that predicts the future popularity of items, and a personalized ranking scenario that recommends items of interest to users. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate BiRank's soundness (fast convergence), efficiency (linear in the number of graph edges), and effectiveness (achieving state-of-the-art in the two real-world tasks).},
