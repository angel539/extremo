abstract = "This paper presents the first step of a research programme implemented by IFSTTAR in order to develop an integrative simulation platform able to support a Human Centred Design (HCD) method for virtual design of driving assistances. This virtual platform, named COSMO-SiVIC, implements a COgnitive Simulation MOdel of the DRIVEr (i.e. COSMODRIVE) into a Vehicle–Environment–Sensors platform (named SiVIC, for Simulateur Véhicule-Infrastructure-Capteur). From this simulation tool based on a computational driver model, the design costs of driving assistances is expected to reduce in the future, and the end-users needs during the design process are also better taken into account. This article is mainly focussed on the description of the driver model developed and implemented on the SiVIC virtual platform, which is only the first step towards a future Virtual HCD integrated tool. The first section will discuss the research context and objective, and the second one will present the theoretical background in cognitive sciences supporting our driver modelling approach. Then, the SiVIC tool is used in this research as a methodological and technical support for both empirical data collection among human drivers and as a virtual road environment to be interfaced with the COSMODRIVE model. In the result section, the functional architecture of COSMO-SIVIC (based on three complementary modules of Perception, Decision and Action) will be described, and an example of virtual simulation of human driver's errors due to visual distraction while driving will be presented. The perspectives concerning future use of COSMO-SIVIC for virtual HCD will be then discussed in the conclusion section."

abstract = "The Ambient Intelligence (AmI) technologies have the potential to create intelligent environments with new generation of assistive services, enhanced with ubiquitous robots. These environments have the ability to be anticipatory, responsive and intelligent providers of assistive services anytime and anywhere. These services can assist frail persons effectively in their daily tasks. One of the main challenging research problems in assistive robotics is to endow ubiquitous robots with ability to pro-actively taking on some tasks to help humans in performing complex activities, by participating with them just as other humans do, in normal societies or organizations. In this paper, we propose a collective intelligence framework based on narrative reasoning and natural language processing. In the proposed approach, we propose a hybrid model that bridges together the Narrative Knowledge Representation Language (NKRL), from natural language processing field, and the HARMS (Humans, software Agents, Robots, Machines and Sensors) model, from multi-agent systems engineering field. This model is able to (i) drive the dialogues between humans, robots and smart devices, (ii) understand a complex situation, and (iii) trigger reactive actions, in the ubiquitous environment, according to given contexts. Two scenarios dedicated to the assistance of a frail person in a smart home equipped with a companion robot and smart objects are implemented and discussed for validation purposes of the proposed framework."

abstract = "Aimed at improving the proactive benefits of Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) for predicting construction project changes, this paper presents CA-FCM: a Context-aware Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping approach. CA-FCM’s main functionality is to imitate the intuitive causal judgements of project experts over change causation in different contextual settings. Invoking the logical inference capabilities of semantic web tools, a hybrid inference mechanism is embedded within the proposed framework which enables establishing contextual connections between prospective causal factors through a semi-automated process of generating relevant causal statements. Hence, CA-FCM can assist decision-makers with (1) a shared sense-making of the domain concepts which would significantly facilitate the manual construction of FCM scenarios, (2) providing contextualized recommendations of causal information required for developing FCM scenarios, (3) dynamic modelling of causal inferences, imitating expert reasoning on change causation and propagation. Towards providing a detailed delineation of CA-FCM’s effectiveness on providing assistance in planning for project changes, a partial implementation of the proposed framework was conducted within a real case scenario."

abstract = "Manual tasks play an important role in social sustainable manufacturing enterprises. Commonly, manual operations are used for low volume productions, but are not limited to. Operational models in manufacturing systems based on “x-to-order” paradigms (e.g. assembly-to-order) may require manual operations to speed-up the ramp-up time of new product configuration assemblies. The implications of manual operations in any production line may imply that any manufacturing or assembly process become more susceptible to human errors and therefore translate into delays, defects and/or poor product quality. In this scenario, virtual and augmented realities can offer significant advantages to support the human operator in manual operations. This research work presents the development of a mixed (virtual and augmented) reality assistance system that permits real-time support in manual operations. A review of mixed reality techniques and technologies was conducted, where it was determined to use a projection mapping solution for the proposed assistance system. According to the specific requirements of the demonstration environment, hardware and software components were chosen. The developed mixed reality assistance system was able to guide any user without any prior knowledge through the successful completion of the specific assembly task."
